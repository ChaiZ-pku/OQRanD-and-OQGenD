## OQRanD and OQGenD

Dataset OQRanD and OQGenD for paper "Asking the crowd: Asking the Crowd: Question Analysis, Evaluation and Generation for Open Discussion on Online Forums" by Zi Chai, Xinyu Xing, Xiaojun Wan and Bo Huang. This paper is accepted by ACL'19.

It will take me some time to clean up the data. I promise that all materials will become available after I attending ACL'19, before September, 2019.

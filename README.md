## OQRanD and OQGenD

Dataset OQRanD and OQGenD for paper "Asking the crowd: Asking the Crowd: Question Analysis, Evaluation and Generation for Open Discussion on Online Forums" by Zi Chai, Xinyu Xing, Xiaojun Wan and Bo Huang. This paper is accepted by ACL'19.

The OQGenD dataset can be viewed at "OQGenD.xml". Each data (NQ-pairs) contain a certain piece of news with multiple related open-answered questions.

It will take me some time to clean up the OQRanD dataset. I promise that all materials will become available this month.
